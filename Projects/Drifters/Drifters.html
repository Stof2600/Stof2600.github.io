				<h2>CONCEPT</h2>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">DRIFTERS is a fighting/combat game where each character uses a different genre/style for its gameplay</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">Miltary shooter games already demostrate something similar with their controllable tank and airplanes</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">I want to expand this on a way larger scale, to the point where a 2D fighter character can compete with a tank, and a strategy game character can keep an eye on the fight to steal points at the most optimal situation</h3>
				<br>
				<h2>BALANCING</h2>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">While balancing is important, realism for weapons and attacks will make the game more fun for all players</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">This means that firearms should kill quickly and explosives should tear a character in half</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">In order to balance this these should have draw-backs like weapon jamming, being difficult to use or limiting them heavily</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">as an example of this, the tank character I'm currently working on has to aim the turret by spinning the left stick in the direction they want to look</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">For the characters that can't use these high damage weapons their movement options and awareness can be increased</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">However I will not be increasing their health stat unless absolutely necessary</h3>
				<br>
				<h2>REASON TO MAKE THIS GAME</h2>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">Imagine you want to play a game with your friend, they want to play a top-down shooter, but you want to play a beat'em up, immediately your plan is ruined</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">I've run into this problem too many times, I'll fix it since no one else will</h3>
				<br>
				<h2>ADDITIONAL CONTENT</h2>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">I could add campaigns to play for specific characters, some of which could be co-op</h3>
				<h3 class="noSpaceText">But this is a huge task, and getting the base game to work is more important so extra will happen for now</h3>
