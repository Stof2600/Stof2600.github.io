				<h2>START</h2>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">During one of the school years at SintLucas Eindhoven I took an interest in shader programming</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">All the students had to take an extra subject, these could be picked from a list</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">One of the subject was Software Deepening, in which you could study any software of your choosing</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">As long as you had a clear goal and your progress was properly documented you could work on whatever you wanted</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h2>SHADERS</h2>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">I picked to work on Unity HLSL with the goal to create shaders and lighting with a similar look as Shadow of the colossus (PS2) for a single scene</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">While that original goal is difficult to reach within the 13 weeks we had, the end result is still pretty good</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">In that time I made 2 shaders and made some GPU instanced grass</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">The first shader is for sand, if the player walks on it it leaves a trail</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">The second one is a fairly basic water shader</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">I also spent a long time trying to get the lighting bake to be proper</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">At the end I had a good looking scene with an above 60FPS framerate</h3>
