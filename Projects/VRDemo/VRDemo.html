                    <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">This was one of my first projects from when I started in game development</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">Virtual reality was very popular at the time and my school had a HTC Vive and PC for me to work on</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">The original plan was to make a game where you can craft items and weapons yourself</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">The player could do this by finding parts or materials in levels and would then have to process them in some kind of hub world</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h2>MESSING AROUND IN VR</h2>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">None of the original idea is in the last build of the game</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">I made a pistol to try coding weapons and found it really fun to mess with</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">After that the project shifted into trying to make realistic Firearms</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h2>FIREARMS</h2>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">Since my 3D modeling and animation skills aren't that good all of the weapons are driven with physics and script</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">Because its an early project the code isn't all that good, and all the weapon script was done in a single file</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">The grabbing and reloading is also very imprecise up to the point where some weapons take a few attempts to reload</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h2>ADITIONAL STUFF</h2>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">I worked on this project for about a year</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">While weapons where the main priority I did work on some other stuff</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">There is an AI system for enemies in the game which I remember being very intricate and annoying to write</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">However it did work and while testing the AI seemed pretty smart</h3>
                    <h3 class="noSpaceText">I sadly can't find any images on the AI or their system</h3>
