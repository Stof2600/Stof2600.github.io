                <h3 class="NoSpaceText">My name is Stef Schouten, I am currently a student at SintLucas in Eindhoven for software development.</h3>
                <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I want to become a good game developer/programmer focusing mostly on 3D or VR projects since I think those are the most interesting.</h3>
                <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I've worked with a lot of programming languages already, this includes: c#, c, html and js.</h3>
                <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I mostly work in Unity and have written multiple small games and demos of all different kinds<br>(3D, 2D, VR, Mobile)(not all on projects page sadly) and I make 3D models for these games myself in blender, I also make all 2D assets myself.</h3>

                <h3>I also know the basics for web development, but I prefer to work on games or more complicated systems so don't try to hire me for web development, I'll decline.</h3>
                <h3>I prefer to work on my own projects because I always make things I find more difficult or interesting. I can work with multiple people on a project but if I'm the one in charge I'll replace assets that don't look good to me which can cause some problems.</h3>
                <h3>My privacy is very important to me, so I won't be sharing too much about my hobbies or interest unless you ask me in person. I will share that I like making a lot of thing, mostly games but also more physical stuff like forging knifes or working with engines, electricity or stuff made of wood or metal.</h3>
                <h3>If you are having problems with a software project or need more people on board for one, you can hire me to help you with programming or other technical stuff. Check the contact info on how to reach me by selecting the tab in the top bar.</h3>
