            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I already had a fairly good weapon system from one of my VR projects, but since I didn't like how mechanical it felt i decided to write a new one using mostly physics based operations.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">This new system uses Unity's physics engine to handle all collision and moving parts of the weapons, and firing is done using projectiles instead of hitscan.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">The 3D models for this had to be custom-made and are mostly accurate to the size of the real thing</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Technical stuff:</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">The game was written and built in unity.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">The basis for the VR setup was done using the SteamVR addon.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Since bullets go faster than the frame-rate they still use raycast's to retrace their path to check for collision.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Moving parts are usually frozen in place when not in use.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Script is used to check the state of the gun and reading VR inputs for firing.</h3>

            <h3 class="FeaturesText">CURRENTLY IN DEMO:<br>-Basic FPS controls<br>-Physics & AI targets</h3>
            <h3 class="FeaturesText">PROBLEMS IN DEMO:<br>-Bolt action rifle is not included due to physics problems<br>-pistol sometimes doesn't load magazine properly</h3>

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">This is my biggest project that I'm currently working on.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">It's a 3D fighting game using a combat system similar to For honor by Ubisoft and mostly inspired by Guilty Gear made by ArcSystemWorks.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Compared to the games it's inspired by it has a lot of differences: the attacks and combat is way faster than For honor and it cant be compared to Guilty Gear because it's a 2D game instead of 3D like mine.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Adding to these differences I'm busy with making a game mode which I've never seen done before in the way I'm planning.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Technical stuff:</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I'm using Unity3D for this project.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I'm making all the 3D models, animations, UI, Effects and script for AI, combat and game management myself.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">The most technical part so far was either the shader for the center line and special zones. Or the blood effect which I want to have stick to the map and stay there until the match is done.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Other than that it's mostly just attack lists, stats for characters, and AI written using Unity's AI system as a base</h3>

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">For a school project we needed to make a game using touch screen controls.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">I decided to make a racing game mostly copying Mario kart DS because the controls in that game are very simple but very good.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText"></h3>

            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">All 3D models & maps were custom-made by myself (except map 1) using blender.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">The ingame camera is put through a filter to make the game look pixelated.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">Movement for karts is done using a rigidbody.</h3>
            <h3 class="NoSpaceText">AI gets next checkpoint from list and detects direction via raycasts.</h3>
